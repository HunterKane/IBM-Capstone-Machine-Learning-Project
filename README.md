# Final Assignment

Objective: Build a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off.

You load a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. You are expected to use the following algorithms to build your models:

- k-Nearest Neighbour

- Decision Tree

- Support Vector Machine

- Logistic Regression

__The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:__

- Jaccard index

- F1-score

- LogLoss


## Review Criteria

This final project will be graded by your peers who are completing this course during the same session. This project is worth **25** marks of your total grade, broken down as follows:

1. Building model using KNN, finding the best k and accuracy evaluation (**7 marks**)
2. Building model using Decision Tree, finding the best k and accuracy evaluation (**6 marks**)
3. Building model using SVM, finding the best k and accuracy evaluation (**6 marks**)
4. Building model using Logistic Regression, finding the best k and accuracy evaluation (**6 marks**)

Load a dataset using Pandas library, and apply the following algorithms, and find the best one for this specific dataset by accuracy evaluation methods.
