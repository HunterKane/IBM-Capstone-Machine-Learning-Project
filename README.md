# Final Assignment

## Review Criteria

This final project will be graded by your peers who are completing this course during the same session. This project is worth **25** marks of your total grade, broken down as follows:

1. Building model using KNN, finding the best k and accuracy evaluation (**7 marks**)
2. Building model using Decision Tree, finding the best k and accuracy evaluation (**6 marks**)
3. Building model using SVM, finding the best k and accuracy evaluation (**6 marks**)
4. Building model using Logistic Regression, finding the best k and accuracy evaluation (**6 marks**)

Load a dataset using Pandas library, and apply the following algorithms, and find the best one for this specific dataset by accuracy evaluation methods.
